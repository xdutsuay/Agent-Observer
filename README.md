# Agent Memory MCP (MVP)

A minimal, correct, and readable implementation of an Agent Memory service
with a thin MCP-style stdio adapter.

Features:
- Persistent per-repo memory (attempts, failures, decisions, state)
- HTTP API (FastAPI)
- stdio adapter suitable for MCP integration (Zed-compatible)

This version fixes formatting and structural issues from the previous zip.
